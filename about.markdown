## Hey, I'm glad you're here.

**loopstate.dev** is my personal space where code, creativity, and curiosity all intersect. I'm a DevOps Director who loves writing clean infrastructure, automating all the things, and exploring the edges of developer productivity — whether it's through tools, workflows, or mindset.

This site is my digital garage: part blog, part lab, part mixtape.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Tech-focused posts** on DevOps, cloud engineering, and modern dev workflows  
- **Creative builds** that blend code, music, and AI  
- **Short-form videos** and experiments that (hopefully) spark inspiration  
- **Playlists, side projects, and rants** about tech, gaming, and flow states

### Why "loopstate"?

In code, loops are how we keep things moving.  
In music, loops drive the rhythm.  
In life, flow states keep us doing our best work.  
So yeah — *Code. Flow. Repeat.*
